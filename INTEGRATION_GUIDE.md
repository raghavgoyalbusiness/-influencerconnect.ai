# Lovable Project Integration Guide

## Steps to Integrate Lovable Project

### 1. Export from Lovable
- Go to your Lovable project: https://lovable.dev/projects/c850a19f-de11-4ae3-b4c7-56efacee21ec
- Export/download the project files
- Share the files with me so I can integrate them

### 2. Integration Options

#### Option A: Merge Features (Recommended)
- Keep the current vanilla JS structure
- Extract specific features/components from Lovable
- Integrate them into the existing MVP

#### Option B: Framework Migration
- If Lovable uses React/Next.js
- Migrate current MVP to match the framework
- Merge both projects

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Keep both projects separate
- Create API/data layer to share data
- Link between the two applications

### 3. What I Need From You

Please provide:
1. **Lovable project files** (HTML, CSS, JS, or React components)
2. **List of features** you want to integrate:
   - API integration?
   - Different UI components?
   - Additional functionality?
   - Data sources?
3. **Integration priorities** - what's most important?

### 4. Next Steps

Once you share the Lovable project files, I will:
1. Analyze the code structure
2. Identify integration points
3. Merge the features seamlessly
4. Ensure compatibility
5. Test the integrated MVP
